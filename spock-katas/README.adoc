= Spock Katas

This workshop is composed of several small TDD exercises.
You can start with the simplest or jump straight into a more complex one.

In order of complexity they are:

* Simple algorithms:
** The _Fizz/Buzz_ Kata
** The _Anagrams_ Kata
* Complex algorithms
** The _Diamond_ Kata
* Interaction testing
** The _Vending Machine_ Kata

Although you can build all the katas at once from the root it's probably best to `cd` into the kata you want to work on and build only that kata with `../gradlew`.

Each kata is designed to be approached in a test-first fashion so 100% code coverage is _required_.
Prepare to be shamed if your coverage is inadequate!

The skeleton source code in each kata is written in Java but feel free to convert it to Groovy (or any other language) if you prefer.

== Requirements

* JDK 8
* Git
